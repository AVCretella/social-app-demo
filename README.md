## Goal

The goal of this lesson is to get an overview of how the Atlas Functions and HTTPS Endpoints are set up in the Atlas dashboard.

## Task 1: Open the Atlas Data API App

You can get to the Atlas Data API App in two ways:
1. From the Atlas dashboard, select **Database** from the left menu, then select the **Linked App Services** `data` app.
1. From the Atlas dashboard, select the **App Services** tab, then select the `data` **Data API App**.

From this page, you can see the HTTPS Endpoints, and other settings for the Data API App.

## Task 2: HTTPS Endpoints

Select **HTTPS Endpoints** from the left menu.

On the **Data API** tab you will see additional settings that can be configured for the Data API. 

Since we'll be customizing user authentication in the following lesson, we'll need to set the **Create User Upon Authentication** option to `On`, and then click **Save**.
